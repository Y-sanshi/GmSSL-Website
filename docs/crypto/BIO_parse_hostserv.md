# NAME

BIO\_parse\_hostserv - utility routines to parse a standard host and service
string

# SYNOPSIS

    #include <openssl/bio.h>

    enum BIO_hostserv_priorities {
        BIO_PARSE_PRIO_HOST, BIO_PARSE_PRIO_SERV
    };
    int BIO_parse_hostserv(const char *hostserv, char **host, char **service,
                           enum BIO_hostserv_priorities hostserv_prio);

# DESCRIPTION

BIO\_parse\_hostserv() will parse the information given in **hostserv**,
create strings with the host name and service name and give those
back via **host** and **service**.  Those will need to be freed after
they are used.  **hostserv\_prio** helps determine if **hostserv** shall
be interpreted primarily as a host name or a service name in ambiguous
cases.

The syntax the BIO\_parse\_hostserv() recognises is:

    host + ':' + service
    host + ':' + '*'
    host + ':'
           ':' + service
    '*'  + ':' + service
    host
    service

The host part can be a name or an IP address.  If it's a IPv6
address, it MUST be enclosed in brackets, such as '\[::1\]'.

The service part can  be a service name or its port number.

The returned values will depend on the given **hostserv** string
and **hostserv\_prio**, as follows:

    host + ':' + service  => *host = "host", *service = "service"
    host + ':' + '*'      => *host = "host", *service = NULL
    host + ':'            => *host = "host", *service = NULL
           ':' + service  => *host = NULL, *service = "service"
     '*' + ':' + service  => *host = NULL, *service = "service"

    in case no ':' is present in the string, the result depends on
    hostserv_prio, as follows:

    when hostserv_prio == BIO_PARSE_PRIO_HOST
    host                 => *host = "host", *service untouched

    when hostserv_prio == BIO_PARSE_PRIO_SERV
    service              => *host untouched, *service = "service"
