# NAME

BIO\_f\_base64 - base64 BIO filter

# SYNOPSIS

    #include <openssl/bio.h>
    #include <openssl/evp.h>

    const BIO_METHOD *BIO_f_base64(void);

# DESCRIPTION

BIO\_f\_base64() returns the base64 BIO method. This is a filter
BIO that base64 encodes any data written through it and decodes
any data read through it.

Base64 BIOs do not support BIO\_gets() or BIO\_puts().

BIO\_flush() on a base64 BIO that is being written through is
used to signal that no more data is to be encoded: this is used
to flush the final block through the BIO.

The flag BIO\_FLAGS\_BASE64\_NO\_NL can be set with BIO\_set\_flags()
to encode the data all on one line or expect the data to be all
on one line.

# NOTES

Because of the format of base64 encoding the end of the encoded
block cannot always be reliably determined.

# RETURN VALUES

BIO\_f\_base64() returns the base64 BIO method.

# EXAMPLES

Base64 encode the string "Hello World\\n" and write the result
to standard output:

    BIO *bio, *b64;
    char message[] = "Hello World \n";

    b64 = BIO_new(BIO_f_base64());
    bio = BIO_new_fp(stdout, BIO_NOCLOSE);
    BIO_push(b64, bio);
    BIO_write(b64, message, strlen(message));
    BIO_flush(b64);

    BIO_free_all(b64);

Read Base64 encoded data from standard input and write the decoded
data to standard output:

    BIO *bio, *b64, *bio_out;
    char inbuf[512];
    int inlen;

    b64 = BIO_new(BIO_f_base64());
    bio = BIO_new_fp(stdin, BIO_NOCLOSE);
    bio_out = BIO_new_fp(stdout, BIO_NOCLOSE);
    BIO_push(b64, bio);
    while((inlen = BIO_read(b64, inbuf, 512)) > 0)
           BIO_write(bio_out, inbuf, inlen);

    BIO_flush(bio_out);
    BIO_free_all(b64);

# BUGS

The ambiguity of EOF in base64 encoded data can cause additional
data following the base64 encoded block to be misinterpreted.

There should be some way of specifying a test that the BIO can perform
to reliably determine EOF (for example a MIME boundary).
