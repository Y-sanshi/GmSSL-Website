# NAME

OCSP\_request\_add1\_nonce, OCSP\_basic\_add1\_nonce, OCSP\_check\_nonce, OCSP\_copy\_nonce - OCSP nonce functions

# SYNOPSIS

    #include <openssl/ocsp.h>

    int OCSP_request_add1_nonce(OCSP_REQUEST *req, unsigned char *val, int len);
    int OCSP_basic_add1_nonce(OCSP_BASICRESP *resp, unsigned char *val, int len);
    int OCSP_copy_nonce(OCSP_BASICRESP *resp, OCSP_REQUEST *req);
    int OCSP_check_nonce(OCSP_REQUEST *req, OCSP_BASICRESP *resp);

# DESCRIPTION

OCSP\_request\_add1\_nonce() adds a nonce of value **val** and length **len** to
OCSP request **req**. If **val** is **NULL** a random nonce is used. If **len**
is zero or negative a default length will be used (currently 16 bytes).

OCSP\_basic\_add1\_nonce() is identical to OCSP\_request\_add1\_nonce() except
it adds a nonce to OCSP basic response **resp**.

OCSP\_check\_nonce() compares the nonce value in **req** and **resp**.

OCSP\_copy\_nonce() copys any nonce value present in **req** to **resp**.

# RETURN VALUES

OCSP\_request\_add1\_nonce() and OCSP\_basic\_add1\_nonce() return 1 for success
and 0 for failure.

OCSP\_copy\_nonce() returns 1 if a nonce was successfully copied, 2 if no nonce
was present in **req** and 0 if an error occurred.

OCSP\_check\_nonce() returns the result of the nonce comparison between **req**
and **resp**. The return value indicates the result of the comparison.  If
nonces are present and equal 1 is returned. If the nonces are absent 2 is
returned. If a nonce is present in the response only 3 is returned. If nonces
are present and unequal 0 is returned. If the nonce is present in the request
only then -1 is returned.

# NOTES

For most purposes the nonce value in a request is set to a random value so
the **val** parameter in OCSP\_request\_add1\_nonce() is usually NULL.

An OCSP nonce is typically added to an OCSP request to thwart replay attacks
by checking the same nonce value appears in the response.

Some responders may include a nonce in all responses even if one is not
supplied.

Some responders cache OCSP responses and do not sign each response for
performance reasons. As a result they do not support nonces.

The return values of OCSP\_check\_nonce() can be checked to cover each case.  A
positive return value effectively indicates success: nonces are both present
and match, both absent or present in the response only. A non-zero return
additionally covers the case where the nonce is present in the request only:
this will happen if the responder doesn't support nonces. A zero return value
indicates present and mismatched nonces: this should be treated as an error
condition.
