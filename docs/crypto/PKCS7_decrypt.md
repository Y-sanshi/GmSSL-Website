# NAME

PKCS7\_decrypt - decrypt content from a PKCS#7 envelopedData structure

# SYNOPSIS

    #include <openssl/pkcs7.h>

    int PKCS7_decrypt(PKCS7 *p7, EVP_PKEY *pkey, X509 *cert, BIO *data, int flags);

# DESCRIPTION

PKCS7\_decrypt() extracts and decrypts the content from a PKCS#7 envelopedData
structure. **pkey** is the private key of the recipient, **cert** is the
recipients certificate, **data** is a BIO to write the content to and
**flags** is an optional set of flags.

# NOTES

Although the recipients certificate is not needed to decrypt the data it is needed
to locate the appropriate (of possible several) recipients in the PKCS#7 structure.

The following flags can be passed in the **flags** parameter.

If the **PKCS7\_TEXT** flag is set MIME headers for type **text/plain** are deleted
from the content. If the content is not of type **text/plain** then an error is
returned.

# RETURN VALUES

PKCS7\_decrypt() returns either 1 for success or 0 for failure.
The error can be obtained from ERR\_get\_error(3)

# BUGS

PKCS7\_decrypt() must be passed the correct recipient key and certificate. It would
be better if it could look up the correct key and certificate from a database.

The lack of single pass processing and need to hold all data in memory as
mentioned in PKCS7\_sign() also applies to PKCS7\_verify().
