# NAME

BIO\_s\_null - null data sink

# SYNOPSIS

    #include <openssl/bio.h>

    const BIO_METHOD *     BIO_s_null(void);

# DESCRIPTION

BIO\_s\_null() returns the null sink BIO method. Data written to
the null sink is discarded, reads return EOF.

# NOTES

A null sink BIO behaves in a similar manner to the Unix /dev/null
device.

A null bio can be placed on the end of a chain to discard any data
passed through it.

A null sink is useful if, for example, an application wishes to digest some
data by writing through a digest bio but not send the digested data anywhere.
Since a BIO chain must normally include a source/sink BIO this can be achieved
by adding a null sink BIO to the end of the chain

# RETURN VALUES

BIO\_s\_null() returns the null sink BIO method.
