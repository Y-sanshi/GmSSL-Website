# NAME

SSL\_alert\_type\_string, SSL\_alert\_type\_string\_long, SSL\_alert\_desc\_string, SSL\_alert\_desc\_string\_long - get textual description of alert information

# SYNOPSIS

    #include <openssl/ssl.h>

    const char *SSL_alert_type_string(int value);
    const char *SSL_alert_type_string_long(int value);

    const char *SSL_alert_desc_string(int value);
    const char *SSL_alert_desc_string_long(int value);

# DESCRIPTION

SSL\_alert\_type\_string() returns a one letter string indicating the
type of the alert specified by **value**.

SSL\_alert\_type\_string\_long() returns a string indicating the type of the alert
specified by **value**.

SSL\_alert\_desc\_string() returns a two letter string as a short form
describing the reason of the alert specified by **value**.

SSL\_alert\_desc\_string\_long() returns a string describing the reason
of the alert specified by **value**.

# NOTES

When one side of an SSL/TLS communication wants to inform the peer about
a special situation, it sends an alert. The alert is sent as a special message
and does not influence the normal data stream (unless its contents results
in the communication being canceled).

A warning alert is sent, when a non-fatal error condition occurs. The
"close notify" alert is sent as a warning alert. Other examples for
non-fatal errors are certificate errors ("certificate expired",
"unsupported certificate"), for which a warning alert may be sent.
(The sending party may however decide to send a fatal error.) The
receiving side may cancel the connection on reception of a warning
alert on it discretion.

Several alert messages must be sent as fatal alert messages as specified
by the TLS RFC. A fatal alert always leads to a connection abort.

# RETURN VALUES

The following strings can occur for SSL\_alert\_type\_string() or
SSL\_alert\_type\_string\_long():

- "W"/"warning"
- "F"/"fatal"
- "U"/"unknown"

    This indicates that no support is available for this alert type.
    Probably **value** does not contain a correct alert message.

The following strings can occur for SSL\_alert\_desc\_string() or
SSL\_alert\_desc\_string\_long():

- "CN"/"close notify"

    The connection shall be closed. This is a warning alert.

- "UM"/"unexpected message"

    An inappropriate message was received. This alert is always fatal
    and should never be observed in communication between proper
    implementations.

- "BM"/"bad record mac"

    This alert is returned if a record is received with an incorrect
    MAC. This message is always fatal.

- "DF"/"decompression failure"

    The decompression function received improper input (e.g. data
    that would expand to excessive length). This message is always
    fatal.

- "HF"/"handshake failure"

    Reception of a handshake\_failure alert message indicates that the
    sender was unable to negotiate an acceptable set of security
    parameters given the options available. This is a fatal error.

- "NC"/"no certificate"

    A client, that was asked to send a certificate, does not send a certificate
    (SSLv3 only).

- "BC"/"bad certificate"

    A certificate was corrupt, contained signatures that did not
    verify correctly, etc

- "UC"/"unsupported certificate"

    A certificate was of an unsupported type.

- "CR"/"certificate revoked"

    A certificate was revoked by its signer.

- "CE"/"certificate expired"

    A certificate has expired or is not currently valid.

- "CU"/"certificate unknown"

    Some other (unspecified) issue arose in processing the
    certificate, rendering it unacceptable.

- "IP"/"illegal parameter"

    A field in the handshake was out of range or inconsistent with
    other fields. This is always fatal.

- "DC"/"decryption failed"

    A TLSCiphertext decrypted in an invalid way: either it wasn't an
    even multiple of the block length or its padding values, when
    checked, weren't correct. This message is always fatal.

- "RO"/"record overflow"

    A TLSCiphertext record was received which had a length more than
    2^14+2048 bytes, or a record decrypted to a TLSCompressed record
    with more than 2^14+1024 bytes. This message is always fatal.

- "CA"/"unknown CA"

    A valid certificate chain or partial chain was received, but the
    certificate was not accepted because the CA certificate could not
    be located or couldn't be matched with a known, trusted CA.  This
    message is always fatal.

- "AD"/"access denied"

    A valid certificate was received, but when access control was
    applied, the sender decided not to proceed with negotiation.
    This message is always fatal.

- "DE"/"decode error"

    A message could not be decoded because some field was out of the
    specified range or the length of the message was incorrect. This
    message is always fatal.

- "CY"/"decrypt error"

    A handshake cryptographic operation failed, including being
    unable to correctly verify a signature, decrypt a key exchange,
    or validate a finished message.

- "ER"/"export restriction"

    A negotiation not in compliance with export restrictions was
    detected; for example, attempting to transfer a 1024 bit
    ephemeral RSA key for the RSA\_EXPORT handshake method. This
    message is always fatal.

- "PV"/"protocol version"

    The protocol version the client has attempted to negotiate is
    recognized, but not supported. (For example, old protocol
    versions might be avoided for security reasons). This message is
    always fatal.

- "IS"/"insufficient security"

    Returned instead of handshake\_failure when a negotiation has
    failed specifically because the server requires ciphers more
    secure than those supported by the client. This message is always
    fatal.

- "IE"/"internal error"

    An internal error unrelated to the peer or the correctness of the
    protocol makes it impossible to continue (such as a memory
    allocation failure). This message is always fatal.

- "US"/"user canceled"

    This handshake is being canceled for some reason unrelated to a
    protocol failure. If the user cancels an operation after the
    handshake is complete, just closing the connection by sending a
    close\_notify is more appropriate. This alert should be followed
    by a close\_notify. This message is generally a warning.

- "NR"/"no renegotiation"

    Sent by the client in response to a hello request or by the
    server in response to a client hello after initial handshaking.
    Either of these would normally lead to renegotiation; when that
    is not appropriate, the recipient should respond with this alert;
    at that point, the original requester can decide whether to
    proceed with the connection. One case where this would be
    appropriate would be where a server has spawned a process to
    satisfy a request; the process might receive security parameters
    (key length, authentication, etc.) at startup and it might be
    difficult to communicate changes to these parameters after that
    point. This message is always a warning.

- "UP"/"unknown PSK identity"

    Sent by the server to indicate that it does not recognize a PSK
    identity or an SRP identity.

- "UK"/"unknown"

    This indicates that no description is available for this alert type.
    Probably **value** does not contain a correct alert message.
